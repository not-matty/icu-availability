# UDub-Scheduler

An AI-powered webapp designed to simplify and streamline the course scheduling process for University of Washington students.

## Inspiration
We were motivated by the inefficiencies in UDub’s MyPlan, which makes scheduling more complicated than it needs to be. Our goal was to create a smarter, more intuitive solution that eliminates the usual scheduling headaches.

## What it does
UDub-Scheduler takes the hassle out of course scheduling. With the power of Llama 2, you can simply chat with the AI about your courses, interests, and preferences. The app generates a perfect schedule instantly and even maps out course locations on a clean, interactive map—super convenient for navigating campus.

## How we built it
We fine-tuned Llama 2 using Intel’s AI PC, training the model with sample prompts and scheduling data. After refining the chatbot, we integrated it into a sleek, user-friendly webapp that allows for real-time schedule generation and visualization.

## Challenges we faced
Getting RAG Llama to run on Intel’s cloud proved to be tricky at first. However, we adapted quickly, learning as we went, and continued making progress without skipping a beat.

## Accomplishments
We’re proud of how smoothly everything came together. By overcoming technical challenges, we’ve built an AI-driven scheduler that just works, delivering a seamless user experience.

## What's next for UDub-Scheduler
- Multi-quarter planning
- Course recommendations based on Rate My Professor sentiment analysis
- Reducing AI hallucinations by injecting real-time course catalog and prerequisite data during inference
